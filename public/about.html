<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hello, my name is Jackie I am a new Web Developer. Thanks for letting me join the club!
  I wanted to get into web development because you are always learning. A forever student they say.
  I think it is very important keep learning and evolving in life.
  Another reason I got into web development is because you are frequently solving puzzles.
  I like the challenges of problem solving and figuring out puzzles!
  Lastly, There is a creative technique that ties to web development.
  Its fun to get your code set up and then add little fun details to it.
